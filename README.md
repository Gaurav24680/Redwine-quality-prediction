# Redwine-quality-prediction
The goal of this project is to predict the quality of red wine based on various chemical properties.The data set contains several features such as fixed acidity,volatile acidity,citric acid,residual sugar,chlorides,free sulfur dioxide,density, ph value,sulphates,alchohol,quality, which influence the wine's overall quality rating.
To build a predictive model,i implemented  Random Forest, a popular ensemble machine learning algorithm,to handle both classification or regression .The model is trained on the available dataset and evaluated for accuracy.
in summary ,my project provides a system that can predict the quality of red wine based on its chemical attributes,demonstrating the power of machine learning in real world application like this one.
